# Spots - Project 3(responsive webpage)

Spots is a project on resposive webpage design. The webpage that I have created will appeal to all users either on mobile devices or on a computer desktop. The web page will change depending on the screen resolution and will appeal for that resolution. To structure the webpage I used BEM methodology and a grid layout. For file stucture I also used BEM to make my files easy to navigate and read.

## Technologies used

The technologies i used for this consist of HTML and CSS to build a responsive web page. The web page will adjust to various screen sizes including desktop computers and mobile devices.
